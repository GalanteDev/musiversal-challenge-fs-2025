## 📘 API Documentation

After starting the backend, Swagger UI is available at:

[http://localhost:4000/docs](http://localhost:4000/docs)

---

## 🖼️ Protected Images & Auto-Seeding

To enhance the developer experience and provide immediate visual feedback, the server preloads **3 protected songs** on every startup:

- **Hammer Smashed Face** – Cannibal Corpse (`canibalcorpse.png`)
- **Roots Bloody Roots** – Sepultura (`sepultura.png`)
- **Raining Blood** – Slayer (`slayer.png`)

These cover images are copied from the `static-images/` folder into `uploads/` **only if they are missing**. Deleting them from `uploads/` and restarting the server will restore them (as long as they exist in `static-images/`).

> ⚠️ Make sure to include the `/server/static-images` folder with these files when cloning the repo.

---

## 📋 Environment Variables

### Backend (`server/.env`)

```env
PORT=4000
```

### Frontend (`client/.env`)

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

Adjust `VITE_API_URL` when deploying the frontend.
