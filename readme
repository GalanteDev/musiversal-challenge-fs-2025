## 📦 Image Seeding (Development Convenience)

On server start, the app **preloads 3 seed songs**:

- Hammer Smashed Face – Cannibal Corpse
- Roots Bloody Roots – Sepultura
- Raining Blood – Slayer

These songs come with protected cover images located in the `/static-images` folder.

**Important notes:**

- If any of these images are missing from `static-images`, the preload will skip them.
- If you delete these songs and restart the server, they will **reappear** with their images — unless the images have been deleted.
- This was implemented to ease development and give a visual idea of how the library looks when populated.

> ⚠️ If you clone this repo, **make sure to include the `/static-images` folder with the `.png` files** for proper functionality.
